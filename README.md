# Credit Score classification using k-nearest neighbors
Application of K nearest neighbor algorithm to predict credit score

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. While it can be used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm, working off the assumption that similar points can be found near one another. 

This project aims to predict the credit score of a person by training a KNN model using features like
